cmvn master:

* Experimental Jackage integration (http://jackage.tototec.de/): Command --fetch
  added to fetch all dependencies provided by jackage
* Much improved cmndline interface
* Rewrite of internal handling of cmvn project
* Eclipse Plugin can find dependencies if project was configured with
  --maven-settings
* Added a converter from pom.xml to cmvn.conf
* Support for Maven <reporting> section
* Use new cmdline parser CmdOption (https://github.com/ToToTec/CmdOption/)
* Removed JCommander dependency
* Support for repository layout setting.

cmvn-0.1.8.1 - 2011-12-12:

* Fixed Import-Package statement of Eclipse-Plugin

cmvn-0.1.8 - 2011-11-10:

* Improved interactive experience with output-filter (that component, that cuts
  the noise [INFO] prefixes from the Maven output), e.g. when using an OSGi
  console from within a Maven plugin, you will now see the osgi> prompt
  instantly
* Use scala code again
* Fixed dependency option parsing and added source file and line number to
  error messages
* Added requireCmvn-tag to force a compatible cmvn version
* Removed version in comment from generated config class file so that storing
  it in version control (although generate) does not produce uneccessary noise
* Support more built-in variables: P, PN, PV, PG as GAV accessors to provide a
  replacement to Mavens varibles, e.g. ${project.artifactId}
* Created a Eclipse Plugin that provides a Cmvn Classpath Container - say goodby
  to slow and resource hungry Maven Plugin

cmvn-0.1.6 - 2011-09-19:

* Added Eclipse .classpath file generator
* Updated manual
* Added support for provided-scoped dependencies
* Fixed up-to-date check problems
* Added support for project-global dependency exclusion (exclude:)

cmvn-0.1.4 - 2011-04-11:

* Fixed generated systemPath for system-dependencies with relative jar path
* Added Windows-Executable (build with Launch4J)

cmvn-0.1.3 - 2011-04-10:

* Better error output: config file and line number of bad key-value pair
* Use mvn.bat as default maven executable under windows
* changed impl of config file reader to support variables in includes and
  conditionals
* Fixed generated systemPath for dependencies with classifier
* Use yaml as file format for persistent cmvn state
* Fixed bug in plugin configuration when multiply "-xml:"-prefixed options were
  added into the wrong position in xml tree
* configure testSources in build-section

cmvn-0.1.2 - 2011-03-02:

* Fixed: Errors while parsing pom.xml.cmvn are silently dropped and all
  content of template file is ignored further
* Let user specifiy Maven executable (--maven-bin)
* cmvn-0.1.1 looses configured state in some situations
* Also respect classifier when (distinct) comparing dependencies so that it is
  possible to include same GA with different classifier in dependency list
  (e.g. a normal jar and the tests-jar)
* Improved ivy.xml and ivysettings.xml generation
* Experimental support for forced system-scope dependencies
* Experimental support for systen-scoped dependency to local available
  artifacts, thus making the 'install' goal of maven unneccessary (using the
  'package' goal is now equal and better)
* New default: --auto-regenerate
* Regenerating a sub-module does not change state outside of this
  module/directory
* Added new build option --build-from-root to start Maven always from root
  project with the complete reactor (alowing to use -am and -amd options)
* Added support for finalName and targetDir in build-block

cmvn-0.1.1 - 2011-01-19:

* Generated files now have correct default XML namespace set
* Added new directive -configClass to generate Java classes to make
  configuration information statically available
* Experimental support for generating ivy.xml files
