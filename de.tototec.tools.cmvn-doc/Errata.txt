  2.1.3. Using Templates – pom.xml.cmvn
  When cmvn detects the presence of a ﬁle pom.xml.cmvn it will use it as template when
  generating the pom.xml ﬁle for Maven. cmvn will ﬁrst read the template ﬁle and afterward
  extend it with the settings found in cmvn.conf. You can use this to easily migrate existing
  Maven projects or if you need complex setups and Maven features (like <profile>).
